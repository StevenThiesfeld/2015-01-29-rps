# The driver method is doing too much -- really, all it should do
# is create two players, tell them to play until theyâ€™re done
# (this should be a single method call), and then report the winner.
# Make this happen by way of creating a Game class; the driver method
# creates two players, creates the game, gives the players to the game,
# then tells the game to start. When the game is done, it reports its
# result back to the driver class. The only methods of the Game class
# that your driver should ever see are new and play. It is very likely
# that your Game class will have other methods, but the only methods
# that your driver should ever interact with are new and play.
